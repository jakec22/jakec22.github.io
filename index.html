	<h1> Pop Punk Is Coming Back Diggity Dog </h1>		

	<p> My Chemical Romance is similar to Jesus Christ himself. I love the way they have their emo hair and give off the aestetic of, "I cut myself". 
	 Like srsly omfg they are so freaking hot. I want a real emo man who can dance like the cyber goth pplz. They are so damn Marty McFly and I just
	want to run off to some romantic island of death and marry every one of them. Im also a cool punk girl that likes skateboarders, and rock stars. I'd
	be so down to be a groupie with some kewl punk and death metal bands. </p>
